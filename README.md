## Concept
REMGuard is a nightmare intervention system that combines medical-grade ECG monitoring with machine learning to detect and interrupt nightmares during their early stages, preventing sleep disruption and improving overall mental health.


## Utilization
### How It Works:

**Detection**: BioAmp EXG sensors capture heart rate variability and ECG patterns throughout the night

**Analysis**: Our ML model identifies REM sleep distress signatures that precede nightmares

**Intervention**: Upon detecting nightmare onset, the system triggers gentle vibration to wake the user before full nightmare development

**Tracking**: The companion app provides sleep quality scores, nightmare frequency metrics, and long-term pattern analysis

**Primary Users**: Sleep enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals seeking optimized sleep quality

**Clinical Applications**: People with PTSD, anxiety, depression, or chronic nightmare disorders

**Integration Flexibility**: Works standalone with our hardware or integrates data from Apple Watch, Samsung, and Oura Ring

**Subscription Model**: Users can access our ML-powered analysis through app subscription, with optional proprietary hardware purchase


## Competitive Advantage:
Unlike consumer wearables that use 90-95% accurate optical sensors, REMGuard employs research-grade ECG for direct electrical heart activity measurement.
